I am a **Research Scientist at Meta Platforms Inc.** based in Menlo Park, CA. My mission is to build AI systems that are as efficient as they are intelligent—bridging the gap between massive foundation models and the practical constraints of distributed hardware.

My expertise lies at the intersection of **Federated Learning (FL)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Computer Vision (CV)**. I thrive on solving the "orchestration" problem of AI: how do we make thousands of diverse devices work together to learn, reason, and perceive the world?

### 🔬 Research Pillars

*   **Collaborative Intelligence (FL + Game Theory)**: I design incentive-driven mechanisms to make distributed training more robust. My work in *AAAI '25* introduced game-theoretic auctions to optimize how devices participate in the global learning process.
*   **Foundation Models & Multi-Modal Alignment**: I explore how the reasoning power of LLMs can be applied to numerical and sensory data. By aligning text with time-series signals, I help create models that can "understand" temporal patterns through natural language.
*   **Resource-Aware AI Optimization**: I specialize in the joint scheduling of devices and training tasks. My research in *IEEE IoT-J* focuses on maximizing model accuracy while strictly respecting the latency and energy limits of wireless and IoT networks.

### 🎓 The Journey

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from **Louisiana State University (LSU)**, where I was supervised by [Prof. Xiangwei Zhou](https://www.ece.lsu.edu/xwzhou/). My academic foundation was built at the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**, where I earned my Master's and Bachelor's degrees.

I believe the future of AI isn't just in bigger models, but in **smarter collaboration**. Whether at Meta or in my open research, I'm working to make that future a reality.
