Welcome to Xiaobing's website. I am a Research Scientist at **Meta Platforms Inc.** (Menlo Park, United States). I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from **Louisiana State University (LSU)**, Baton Rouge, United States, where I was supervised by [Prof. Xiangwei Zhou](https://www.ece.lsu.edu/xwzhou/).

My research interests include Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Federated Learning, Distributed Learning, Self-supervised Learning, Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Communication, and Game Theory.

Previously, I received my master's degree in Control Science and Engineering and bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2020 and 2017, respectively.
