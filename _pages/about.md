I am a **Research Scientist at Meta Platforms Inc.** based in Menlo Park, CA, where I translate billion-scale user signals into measurable product wins. My work sits at the intersection of **Massive-Scale Machine Learning** and **Autonomous Systems**—bridging the gap between theoretical intelligence and practical, reliable application.

I believe the future of AI isn't just about bigger models, but about **smarter orchestration**. Whether optimizing graph neural networks for billions of users or building autonomous agent fleets, I focus on creating systems that are robust, efficient, and impactful.

### 🚀 Impact at Scale (Meta)

At Meta, I architect and deploy machine learning systems that power core discovery and integrity experiences for billions of users. My focus is on **turning complex signals into Tier-0 product wins**.

*   **Scale:** Designed graph-based user representation learning systems that scale to billions of nodes, unlocking new capabilities for signal-sparse populations.
*   **Efficiency:** Architected offline evaluation frameworks and training pipelines that significantly reduced compute overhead while accelerating iteration velocity for the entire team.
*   **Product:** Led multiple high-impact launches across Instagram and Facebook, driving global engagement wins and integrity improvements through novel feature engineering and model architecture optimizations.

### ⚡ The Frontier: Agentic Systems

Beyond industrial ML, I am deeply invested in the future of **Collaborative AI and Multi-Agent Systems**. I believe the next leap in productivity comes from **workflow consolidation**—where specialized agents orchestrate complex tasks autonomously.

**Current Exploration:**
*   **Autonomous Orchestration:** Building upon "OpenClaw," a personal exploration into multi-agent fleets that can plan, execute, and self-heal.
*   **Workflow Consolidation:** Moving beyond "chatbots" to "do-bots"—agents that integrate deep into tools and infrastructure to automate research and engineering loops.
