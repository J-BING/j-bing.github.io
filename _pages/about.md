Welcome to Xiaobing's website. I'm Xiaobing Chen, a EE Ph.D. student at Louisiana State University (LSU), Baton Rouge, United States, supervised by [Prof. Xiangwei Zhou](https://www.ece.lsu.edu/xwzhou/). I'm interested in distributed computation, federated learning, representation learning, and other advanced modern learning schemes addressing the resource-limited computation and collaborative computation issues existing in the academy and industries. 

I received a master's degree in Control Science and Engineering and a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2017 and 2020, respectively. During that time, I became interested in machine learning and worked on representation learning and cross-modality feature fusion on the Visual Question Answering (VQA).
