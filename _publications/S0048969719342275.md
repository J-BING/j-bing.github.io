excerpt: 'Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an important haze index, and the researches on the evolutionary characteristics of the PM2.5 concentration will provide a fundamental and guiding prerequisite for the haze prediction. However, the past researchers were usually based on the overall time-domain evolution information of PM2.5. Since the temporal evolution of PM2.5 concentration is nonstationary, previous studies might neglect some important localization features that the evolution has various predominant periods at different scales. Therefore, we applied the wavelet transform to study the localized intermittent oscillations of PM2.5.'

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an important haze index, and the researches on the evolutionary characteristics of the PM2.5 concentration will provide a fundamental and guiding prerequisite for the haze prediction. However, the past researchers were usually based on the overall time-domain evolution information of PM2.5. Since the temporal evolution of PM2.5 concentration is nonstationary, previous studies might neglect some important localization features that the evolution has various predominant periods at different scales. Therefore, we applied the wavelet transform to study the localized intermittent oscillations of PM2.5.
